1. I made this project .NET CORE 3.1. Here I used Web API core for REST API and Entity Framework Core for CURD operations.
2. Into the Database folder you will get database backup file. Restore this database. I made this database on MS SQL Server 2017 .
3. Into the "appsettings.json" file change Database connection string according to your database location.
4. Swagger is configured into the project. So you can check REST API through Swagger. I configured it for unit testing.
